"""
Tests for connection_management.py module.

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the ConnectionManagementMixin class,
following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to validate expected behavior
and uncover potential bugs.

Coverage areas:
- Connection setup and initialization
- JWT authentication and URL construction
- Dual-hub connection management (user and market hubs)
- SignalR event handler registration
- Connection lifecycle (connect/disconnect)
- Automatic reconnection and error handling
- JWT token refresh with deadlock prevention
- Connection state recovery mechanisms
- Statistics and health monitoring
- Thread-safe async operations
