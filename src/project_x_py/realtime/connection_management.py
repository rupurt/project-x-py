Connection management functionality for real-time client.

Author: @TexasCoding
Date: 2025-08-02

Overview:
    Provides connection management functionality for the ProjectX real-time client,
    including SignalR hub setup, connection establishment, reconnection handling,
    and secure JWT token authentication.

Key Features:
    - Dual-hub SignalR connection setup and management
    - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
    - JWT token authentication via URL query parameter (ProjectX Gateway requirement)
    - Connection health monitoring and error handling
    - Thread-safe operations with proper lock management
    - Comprehensive connection statistics and health tracking

Connection Management Capabilities:
    - SignalR hub setup with ProjectX Gateway configuration
    - Connection establishment and health monitoring
    - Automatic reconnection with configurable intervals
    - JWT token authentication via URL query parameter (ProjectX Gateway requirement)
    - JWT token refresh and reconnection handling
    - Connection event handling and error processing
    - Statistics tracking and health reporting

Example Usage:
    The functionality of this mixin is consumed through a `ProjectXRealtimeClient` instance.
    For most use cases, this is handled automatically by the `TradingSuite`.

    ```python
    # The following demonstrates the low-level connection lifecycle managed by this mixin.
    # Note: In a typical application, you would use TradingSuite, which handles this.
    from project_x_py import create_realtime_client

    # 1. Initialization (handled by factory or TradingSuite)
    # realtime_client = await create_realtime_client(jwt, account_id)

    # 2. Connection (handled by TradingSuite.create() or client.connect())
    # if await realtime_client.connect():
    #     print("Successfully connected to both User and Market hubs.")

    #     # 3. Health Monitoring
    #     if realtime_client.is_connected():
    #         stats = realtime_client.get_stats()
    #         print(f"Events received so far: {stats['events_received']}")

    #     # 4. Token Refresh (if managing tokens manually)
    #     # new_token = await get_new_token()
    #     # await realtime_client.update_jwt_token(new_token)

    #     # 5. Disconnection (handled by TradingSuite context manager or client.disconnect())
    #     await realtime_client.disconnect()
    ```

        Connect to ProjectX Gateway SignalR hubs asynchronously.

        Establishes connections to both user and market hubs, enabling real-time
        event streaming. Connections are made concurrently for efficiency.

        Returns:
            bool: True if both hubs connected successfully, False otherwise

        Connection Process:
            1. Sets up connections if not already done

        Update JWT token and reconnect with new credentials.

        **CRITICAL FIX**: Implements deadlock prevention through timeout-based reconnection
        and connection state recovery mechanisms.

        Handles JWT token refresh for expired or updated tokens. Disconnects current
        connections, updates URLs with new token, and re-establishes all subscriptions.

        **Deadlock Prevention Features (v3.3.1)**:
            - Connection lock timeout prevents indefinite waiting
            - Automatic rollback to original state on failure
            - Connection state recovery preserves subscriptions
            - Comprehensive error handling with cleanup

        Args:
            new_jwt_token (str): New JWT authentication token from AsyncProjectX
            timeout (float): Maximum time in seconds to wait for reconnection (default: 30.0)
                           Prevents deadlocks by ensuring operation completes within timeout

        Returns:
            bool: True if reconnection successful with new token

        Process:
            1. Acquire connection lock with timeout (DEADLOCK PREVENTION)
            2. Store original state for rollback (STATE RECOVERY)
            3. Disconnect existing connections
            4. Update token and connection URLs
            5. Reset connection state
            6. Reconnect to both hubs with timeout
            7. Re-subscribe to user updates
            8. Re-subscribe to previous market data
            9. Implement connection state recovery on failure (ROLLBACK)

        **Safety Mechanisms**:
            - **Timeout Protection**: 30-second default prevents indefinite blocking
            - **State Recovery**: Original connection state restored on failure
            - **Subscription Preservation**: Market data subscriptions restored automatically
            - **Error Isolation**: Failures don't leave client in inconsistent state

        Example:
            >>> # Token refresh with deadlock prevention
            >>> async def refresh_connection():
            ...     # Get new token
            ...     await project_x.authenticate()
            ...     new_token = project_x.session_token
            ...     # Update with timeout for deadlock prevention
            ...     if await realtime_client.update_jwt_token(new_token, timeout=45.0):
            ...         print("Reconnected with new token")
            ...     else:
            ...         print("Reconnection failed, original state recovered")
            >>>
            >>> # Production usage with error handling
            >>> try:
            ...     success = await realtime_client.update_jwt_token(new_token)
            ...     if success:
            ...         logger.info("Token refresh successful")
            ...     else:
            ...         logger.error("Token refresh failed - check logs")
            ... except TimeoutError:
            ...     logger.error("Token refresh timed out - deadlock prevented")

        Side Effects:
            - Disconnects and reconnects both hubs
            - Re-subscribes to all previous subscriptions
            - Updates internal token and URLs
            - Implements recovery mechanism on failure

        **Performance Impact**:
            - Brief data gap during reconnection (~2-5 seconds)
            - Timeout overhead minimal for successful operations
            - State recovery adds safety with minimal performance cost

        Note:
            - Callbacks are preserved during reconnection
            - Market data subscriptions are restored automatically
            - **NEW**: Deadlock prevention eliminates indefinite blocking
            - **NEW**: Connection state recovery prevents inconsistent states
